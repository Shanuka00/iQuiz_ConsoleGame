# iQuiz_ConsoleGame
This contains my First year, First Semester console game written in C++
Inside the game there are four levels and each level has 5 questions. 
Those 5 questions are blended with IQ questions and general knowledge questions.
If a player wants to continue the game, he or she should have a good general knowledge and IQ knowledge.
You can get more details through the report of the game.
